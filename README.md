# `nix-flake-template`

These is the Nix flake template that I use as a base to configure project
development environments.

- [`flake-parts`](./flake-parts)
  - This template uses [`flake-parts`](https://flake.parts/). This the default.
- [`vanilla`](./vanilla)
  - This template doesn't use [`flake-parts`](https://flake.parts/).

For complete templates for specific languages or frameworks, give
[`the-nix-way/dev-templates`](https://github.com/the-nix-way/dev-templates) a
look, which has a great collection of development environment Nix flake
templates.
